        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Aparna Krishnan, a passionate final-year Computer Science and Engineering student at Government Engineering College, Thrissur. I am always eager to explore new technologies, solve challenging problems, and work on projects that create a positive social impact. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, Java, C, and web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am equally skilled in backend frameworks such as Django and familiar with cloud-based solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            My recent internship experiences have sharpened my ability to work in both product operations and full-stack development. For instance, I worked on the <strong>CalorEase</strong> project, a calorie-tracking web app that helps users manage their dietary intake. The project was selected as a finalist in the <strong>Innovate Challenge</strong> organized by Decathlon Sports India in partnership with Bolt IoT. It showcased my ability to develop health-tech solutions that promote wellness and healthier lifestyles.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also developed a <strong>Facilities Management App</strong> using Flutter and Firebase, focused on streamlining complaint registration and inspections, improving team collaboration, and enhancing user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academics, I actively engage in various extracurricular activities, including painting, playing musical instruments, dancing, and badminton. These hobbies help me stay creative and energized, which I believe complements my technical work.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am driven by my passion for continuous learning and applying my skills to make a difference in the world through technology.
